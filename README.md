# Week one Code Challenge

# Description
This is an exercise to show how java script functions work in applications.

# Getting started

You only need to have Google Chrome well installed and working on your computer. 

## Running the application
 # Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator (Toy Problem)

Step 1: Click on this link: https://brianweekonecodechallenge.netlify.app/ 
Step 2: Click on the click now button. A prompt will open stating: "Enter Marks"
Step 3: Key in your mark in the section provided and hit enter.
Step 4: You should see your grade outputed as either A, B, C, D or E depending on your mark.

Step 2: Click on the "Click me" button. 
Step 3: A prompt will appear on the chrome browser with the statement: "enter speed". 
Step 4: Enter any speed level in the prompt. For example, 40. The prompt should output "OK".

# Challenge 3: Net Salary Calculator (Toy Problem)

Step 1: Open the terminal on vs code.
Step 2: Run the code "node challenge3.js" It should output the Gross salary, PAYE deductions, NSSF deduction, NHIF Deduction, Taxes and compute the salary. 
Step 3: You can use different arguments to test different amounts of salary. 
# Option 2:
Gitclone this repo in a directory using the HTTPS link. 
Step one: On the terminal navigate to the directory you want to clone this file using the cd command.
Step two: Git clone the https of this repository this should copy all files to your directory.
Step three: Run the code . command on terminal to open vs code.
Step four: Open the terminal in VS code.
Step five: Run this command - cd tax-calculator (This should get you to the directory with the JS file)
Step six: Run this command: node tax.js
Step seven: You can adjust the basic salary and benefits to get different figures for NSSF, NHIF and PAYE. (Try 10,000 & 5,000) in the last line of the code) This should input different figures.
